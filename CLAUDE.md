# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for working in this repo. Read this first, then dive into code.

## What this is

A production-style React SPA (based on the Ulbi TV "production project") built with
**Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)**. Backend is a local **json-server** (`json-server/db.json`).
Absolute imports use the `@/` alias → `src/` (webpack + tsconfig `paths`).

## Tech stack (current, verified)

| Area | Choice |
|---|---|
| UI | React **18.3** (`createRoot` in `src/index.tsx`) |
| State | Redux Toolkit **1.9.7** (NOT v2) + react-redux **8.1.3** (redux 4) |
| Server-state | **RTK Query** (`shared/api/rtkApi.ts`) — the modern path; coexists with thunks |
| Router | react-router-dom **6.2** |
| i18n | react-i18next **15** / i18next **23** |
| TS | `typescript@^5.4` (resolves to 5.9); `moduleResolution: "bundler"` |
| Build | webpack **5** (config in `config/build`, entry-agnostic) |
| Stories | Storybook **8.6** (webpack5 + SWC compiler) |
| Tests | jest **29** + `@swc/jest` + testing-library **14** |
| HTTP | axios (`shared/api/api.ts`, `$api`) for thunks; `fetchBaseQuery` for RTK Query |
| Virtualization | react-virtuoso (articles list) |
| UI primitives | **@headlessui/react v2** (Dropdown, ListBox) |
| FSD linter | **steiger** (`lint:fsd`) |

## Commands (npm)

- `npm run type:check` — `tsc --noEmit`
- `npm run lint:ts` / `lint:ts:fix` — eslint (airbnb)
- `npm run lint:scss` / `lint:scss:fix` — stylelint
- `npm run lint:fsd` — steiger (FSD boundaries)
- `npm run unit` — jest
- `npm run build:prod` — production webpack build
- `npm run storybook` / `build-storybook`
- `npm run start:dev` — dev server + json-server (concurrently)

**Before finishing any change, run the CI chain and keep it green** (this is exactly
what `.github/workflows/main.yml` runs, on **node 24.x**):
```
type:check · lint:ts · lint:scss · lint:fsd · unit · build:prod · build-storybook
```

## FSD architecture

Layers, top→bottom (each may import only from layers strictly below, via public API):
```
app → pages → widgets → features → entities → shared
```

Current slices:
- **entities**: Article, Comment, Counter, Country, Currency, Profile, User
- **features**: ArticleComments, AuthByUserName, articleRecommendationsList, LangSwitcher, ThemeSwitcher
- **widgets**: Navbar, Page, PageError, PageLoader, Sidebar
- **pages**: About, ArticleDetails, ArticleEdit, Articles, Main, NotFound, Profile
- **shared/ui**: AppLink, Avatar, Button, Card, Code, Dropdown, Icon, Input, ListBox, Loader, Modal, PageLoader, Portal, Select, Skeleton, Stack (HStack/VStack), Tabs, Text
- **app/providers**: ErrorBoundary, StoreProvider, ThemeProvider, router

### Rules the codebase follows (enforced by steiger)
1. **Public API via `index.ts`** — cross-slice imports go to the slice root
   (`@/entities/Article`), never deep (`@/entities/Article/model/...`).
   **Exception:** `shared/ui`/`shared/lib` have NO per-segment public API — deep
   imports like `@/shared/ui/Button/Button` are the convention.
2. **Same-slice imports are relative** (`../../model/...`), never via own `@/`-barrel.
3. **Entity→entity cross-imports use the `@x` notation.** A provider exposes a
   dedicated API for a consumer: `entities/Country/@x/Profile.ts`, imported as
   `@/entities/Country/@x/Profile`. Existing: `User/@x/Article`, `User/@x/Comment`,
   `Country/@x/Profile`, `Currency/@x/Profile`. (`@x` is just a folder name.)

## Redux store (important, non-obvious)

- Store is built with a **reducer manager** for lazy/async reducers
  (`app/providers/StoreProvider/config/reducerManager.ts`). Slices are registered
  at mount via **`DynamicModuleLoader`** (`shared/lib/components/DynamicModuleLoader`)
  with a `ReducersList`, then removed on unmount.
- **`StateSchema` / `ThunkConfig` live in `app`** (`StoreProvider/config/StateSchema.ts`)
  and are imported "upward" by selectors/thunks in entities/features/pages. This is a
  **known, accepted compromise** (the aggregate schema can't sit in shared without
  pointing back at slices). steiger surfaces these as **warnings, not errors** — see
  `steiger.config.ts`. Removing it fully would need Redux module augmentation.
- Typed dispatch: **`useAppDispatch`** (`shared/lib/hooks/useAppDispatch`) for thunks;
  plain `useDispatch` only for plain actions.

## RTK Query (server-state — preferred direction)

- Base API: `shared/api/rtkApi.ts` (`createApi` + `fetchBaseQuery`, `tagTypes: ['Comments']`).
  Wired into the store (`api` reducer + middleware) and `StateSchema[rtkApi.reducerPath]`.
- Each feature **injects its own endpoints** (`injectEndpoints`) in its `api/` segment,
  e.g. `features/ArticleComments/api/articleCommentsApi.ts` (getComments query +
  addComment mutation with tag invalidation → auto-refetch),
  `features/articleRecommendationsList/api/articleRecommendationsApi.ts`.
- **Two data-fetching paradigms coexist**: legacy `createAsyncThunk`+slice+entityAdapter
  (Profile, Articles, Auth) and RTK Query (Comments, Recommendations). Direction of
  travel = migrate server-state to RTK Query. When adding new fetching, prefer RTK Query.
- Caveat: RTK Query uses `fetch`, thunks use axios `$api` — auth header logic is
  duplicated in both. Fine for now; could unify with an `axiosBaseQuery`.

## Conventions

- **Styling**: CSS Modules `*.module.scss` + `classNames(cls.Root, mods, [extra])`
  helper. Theme vars under `.app_light_theme` / `.app_dark_theme` (on `<body>` via
  `useTheme`). Theme enum lives in `shared/const/theme`, `useTheme` in `shared/lib/hooks`.
- **Routing consts**: `RoutePath`/`AppRoutes` in `shared/const/router`; the route→page
  map (`routeConfig`) in `app/providers/router/routeConfig`.
- **i18n**: all user-facing text via `t()`. `i18next/no-literal-string` is OFF for
  `*.test.*` and `*.stories.*`.
- **Stories**: SB8, CSF2 template pattern; types `Meta` / `StoryFn` from
  `@storybook/react` (NOT the removed `ComponentMeta`/`ComponentStory`).

## Gotchas learned the hard way

- **CI runs on node 24.x** (set in `main.yml`). The lock was authored by npm 11; node
  22 could fail `npm ci`. Keep node 24 to match.
- **`moduleResolution: "bundler"`** is required — react-i18next 15 ships ESM (`.d.mts`)
  types that `node10` can't resolve; the IDE (TS server) will flag them otherwise.
- **`lint:scss` currently fails on a PRE-EXISTING issue** in
  `src/app/styles/variables/global.scss` (`custom-property-empty-line-before`),
  unrelated to feature work. Don't chase it as if you broke it.
- **Storybook theme portals**: `@headlessui` `anchor` menus render in a `<body>` portal;
  in Storybook `ThemeDecorator` puts the theme class on a `<div>`, so dropdown menus
  render un-themed in SB (fine in the real app, where the class is on `<body>`).
- **Windows + `core.autocrlf=true`**: editing via shell tools can produce LF/CRLF diff
  noise; huge diffs are usually `package-lock.json`, not real churn.
- **Do NOT `rm package-lock.json && npm install`** — it drifts transitive tool versions
  (stylelint/eslint) and changes lint behavior. Use `npm ci` for clean reinstalls, and
  targeted `npm install pkg@ver` for version changes.

## Verification & workflow

- After edits, prefer running only the affected checks first (type:check, eslint on
  changed files, stylelint on changed scss), then the full chain before declaring done.
- `type:check` is the source of truth for type errors and matches the IDE (bundler).
- Do NOT commit/push unless asked. If on `main`, branch first. Current branch:
  **`feat/headlessui`** (working branch for this stream of work).
- Do NOT manually verify in the browser (Chrome MCP: navigate, screenshot, click through
  flows, check console/network) by default. Running the CI chain (type:check, lint, unit,
  build) is enough to call a change done. Only do live browser verification when the user
  explicitly asks for it.

## Reference architecture example (Comments)

Clean pattern to imitate:
```
entities/Comment         — CommentCard, CommentList, CommentForm (presentational), type
features/ArticleComments — api/ (RTK Query) + ui/ (composes list + form for an article)
pages/ArticleDetailsPage — just <ArticleComments id={id} />
```
Pages should be thin composition shells; page-specific UI (e.g. `ArticlesPageList`)
connects to its own slice directly rather than prop-drilling from the page.
